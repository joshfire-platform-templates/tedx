TEDx template for the Joshfire Factory
=======================================

This template is a fork of https://github.com/joshfire-platform-templates/event

Default <- Event <- TEDx

If you do modifications that do not concern TEDx, you should make them in the Event template or in the Default Template (Event is a fork from Default)
Try to only do modiications specific to template tedx here. Thanks.
Then, you have to cherry-pick these commits : add event as an upstream remote, fetch upstream and cherry-pick the commits
